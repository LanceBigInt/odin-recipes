    <h1>Sour and Spicy 'Shrooms (Mushroom Sisig)</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sisig (SEE-sig) is traditionally made with chopped pig's face and served on a sizzling hot platter. The mushrooms here mimic the chewy-meaty quality of pork and don't take nearly as long to prepare. You still get all the salty, tangy, and spicy flavors. And no face gets chopped!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped red onion</li>
        <li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 green onions, white parts chopped and green parts thinly bias-sliced</li>
        <li>4 Thai chile peppers, seeded and minced</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh shiitake mushrooms, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh oyster mushrooms, stemmed and sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup calamansi (Philippine lime) juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons avocado oil mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, and white parts of green onions; cook and stir until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in chiles and mushrooms; cook, stirring, until tender and excess liquid evaporates, 5 to 8 minutes. Add soy sauce and calamansi juice; cook, stirring, until reduced to a glaze consistency, 5 to 7 minutes. Taste and add more soy sauce or calamansi juice to reach desired tanginess and saltiness.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with a dollop of avocado oil mayonnaise and a sprinkle of the green parts of green onions.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Cook's Note </h3>
    <p>Philippine limes (calamansi) have a juice that's unparalleled. They taste like a cross between mandarin orange, lemon, and yuzu. At Asian markets, look for bottled unsweetened juice on the shelf, or frozen juice packets, often sold near banana leaves. In a pinch, substitute a half-and-half mixture of lemon and lime juice and a dash of sugar.</p>
